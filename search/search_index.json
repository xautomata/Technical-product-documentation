We can imagine having a client's asset and a series of services that point to the asset, going to enrich the information present there, or adding functionality.</p>"},{"location":"lld/#the-asset","title":"The asset","text":"<p>As an asset we define everything that constitutes the physical perimeter of the customer.  The asset is defined hierarchically by the following components (in descending hierarchical order):</p> <ul> <li>Customer</li> <li>Site</li> <li>Group</li> <li>Object</li> <li>Metric_type</li> <li>Metric</li> <li>Service</li> </ul> <p>Each of these levels contains information, the customer defines the customer,  the sites define the customer's branches, etc. Each level is connected with a one-to-many link with the lower level; therefore, a site has groups within it,  but a group cannot be in multiple sites.  There is one exception which are the groups, for most of their use they maintain a  one-to-many relationship with the metric_types, but an object can be contained in multiple groups. So let's say that between groups and objects there is a many-to-many relationship. </p> <p>Each element can be identified by a series of primary keys that also include the UUID of its upper level. This is obviously not true for objects because of the many-to-many nature with groups.</p> <p>The services, which close the queue, are a second exception: they have a hierarchical importance  similar to the metrics, they can be linked to the metrics with a many-to-many link but they can also not be linked to the metrics and live completely detached from the asset.  The services represent additional information calculated from customer values or other data,  they are not necessarily linked to the asset. If they are linked to the asset it is through the metrics, in these cases there is a pointer to all the metrics that contributed to forming the service.</p> <p>The structure from the customer to the service represents the asset and is called the tree.</p> <p>To navigate the tree there are APIs that allow you to obtain the link information of one layer with  the others. To make an example, if I know a metric and I want to know in which object it is contained,  in the data of the metric itself there is the uuid of the metric_type that contains it. With that uuid,  I can get the details of the metric_type in which the uuid of the object that contains it is present.  With that uuid I can go and ask for the details of the object I was interested in knowing.</p> <p>It is equally true in the other direction, I know an object I can know all the metric_types  that compose it, chosen one I can ask for all the metrics that compose it.</p> <p>This way of navigating the tree finds some variations when trying to overcome the layers  with many-to-many relationships. To know which groups an object is contained in and vice versa, there are special APIs that given one of the two layers, return you the second. This also applies  to services having the same many-to-many nature.</p> <p>There are shortcuts to navigate the tree, these \"shortcuts\" come in the form of the tree_hierarchy API set. This API is designed to retrieve an element in the tree with all its links with the upper layers.</p>"},{"location":"lld/#time-series","title":"Time series","text":"<p>The asset represents the objects that produce data, but the data itself is collected in a different place.

In this process, we assist companies in formalizing and optimizing their operational flows, transforming the organization into a more intelligent, proactive, and efficient ecosystem.</p> <p>XAutomata was established to fill a critical gap in the automation market: the management and optimization  of complex, dynamic, and often unique business processes that fall outside the capabilities of traditional  Robotic Process Automation (RPA), Business Process Management (BPM), or observability solutions.</p>"},{"location":"vision/#what-need-does-xautomata-address","title":"What Need Does XAutomata Address?","text":"<p>In particular, XAutomata addresses the following crucial needs for modern businesses:</p> <ol> <li>Inefficiency of Manual Complexity: Many organizations struggle with intricate operational processes that are data-intensive or critical (such as IT incident management, predictive maintenance, IoT security) that still require significant human intervention, slow decision-making, and are prone to errors. XAutomata transforms these manual and reactive operations into automated and proactive workflows.</li> <li> <p>Limitations of Existing Solutions:</p> <ul> <li>RPA/BPM: They automate predefined and often linear operational workflows but fail when the process requires dynamic decisions, interaction with numerous third-party systems, coordination of complex time-dependent dependencies, or real-time adaptation to unforeseen events. XAutomata goes beyond automating rules and decisions, not just sequences.</li> <li>Observability Solutions (e.g., PagerDuty, Dynatrace): They excel at monitoring and troubleshooting but stop at reporting a problem. XAutomata integrates with these solutions to provide the next level: autonomous execution of corrective actions and full incident management, from detection to ticket closure.</li> <li>Safe LLM Enablers: Through the behavioral engine, XAutomata can serve as a strict guardrail for the use of LLMs which, if left to operate autonomously, would not be sufficiently safe to handle core business processes.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Lack of Scalability and Adaptability: Existing systems are often rigid, difficult to update, or expand when business requirements change. The modular architecture of XAutomata based on collaborative agents and Kubernetes allows for intrinsic scalability and the ability to easily integrate new steps or resources without disrupting existing processes, ensuring flexibility and long-term sustainability.</p> </li> <li>Need for Proactivity and Predictability: Companies do not just want to react to problems but foresee and prevent them. By integrating machine learning algorithms and statistical methods, XAutomata not only detects anomalies but predicts failures and intervenes automatically or intelligently alerts operators, reducing downtime and costs.</li> <li>Challenges in Formalizing Unique Processes: Many companies have \"unique internal procedures\" that cannot be mapped to standard templates. XAutomata excels at guiding clients through the formalization of these procedures, transforming them into an operational Digital Twin, ensuring that even the most customized processes can be digitized and optimized.</li> <li>Cost and Productivity Optimization: The digitization of the inherent complexities of processes results in a significant increase in productivity (estimated at 60%) and greater sustainability in terms of operational costs compared to traditional hyper-automation solutions.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"vision/#our-strengths","title":"Our Strengths","text":"<ol> <li>Leveraging a Growing and Valuable Market: The demand for intelligent automation and complexity management is steadily increasing across all sectors.
